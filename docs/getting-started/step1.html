      Format <em>identification</em> is the process of determining the format to
      which a digital object conforms; in other words, it answers the question:
      "I have a digital object; what format is it?"
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Format <em>validation</em> is the process of determining the level of
        compliance of a digital object to the specification for its purported format,
        e.g.:
        "I have an object purportedly of format <em>F</em>; is it?"
      </p>
      <p>
        Format validation conformance is determined at three levels:
        <em>well-formedness</em>, <em>validity</em>, and <em>consistency</em>.
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          A digital object is <em>well-formed</em> if it meets the purely
          syntactic requirements for its format
        </li>
        <li>
          An object is <em>valid</em> if it is well-formed and it meets the
          higher-level semantic requirements for format validity
        </li>
        <li>
          An object is <em>consistent</em> if it is valid and its internally
          extracted representation information is consistent with externally
          supplied representation information
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        For example, a <a href="/references#tiff6">TIFF</a> object is
        well-formed if it starts with an 8 byte header followed by a sequence of
        Image File Directories (IFDs), each composed of a 2 byte entry count and
        a series of 8 byte tagged entries.
        The object is valid if it meets certain additional
        semantic-level rules, such as that an RGB file must have at least three sample
        values per pixel.
        The object is consistent with external
        <a href="/references#z39.87">NISO Z39.87</a> metadata if that
        metadata is consistent with the representation information of the object
        that is extracted by JHOVE.
      </p>
      <p>
        The concept of distinguishing between well-formedness (syntactic correctness)
        and validity (semantic correctness) was
        taken from <a href="/references#xml">XML</a>.

      <p>
        Format <em>characterization</em> is the process of determining the
        format-specific significant properties of an object of a given format, e.g.:
        "I have an object of format <em>F</em>; what are its salient properties?"
      </p>
      <p>
        The set of characteristics reported by JHOVE about a digital object
        is known as the object's <em>representation information</em>,
        a concept introduced by the Open Archival Information System (OAIS)
        reference model [<a href="/references#oais">ISO/IEC 14721</a>].
        The standard representation information reported by JHOVE includes:
        file pathname or URI,
        last modification date, byte size, format, format version,
        MIME type, format profiles, and optionally,
        CRC32, MD5, and SHA-1 digests
        [<a href="/references#crc32">CRC32</a>,
        <a href="/references#md5">MD5</a>,
        <a href="/references#sha1">SHA-1</a>].
