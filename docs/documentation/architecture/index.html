    <h1>Architecture</h1>
    <p>
      JHOVE is designed as a layered architecture with an API (with well-defined,
      public interfaces) invoked by a thin application layer for a stand-alone,
      command line tool, applicable for batch and interactive operation.
      The API can be used on its own to create other compatible tools.
